### üìò Abstract

> _In this theater, the characters are not figments of a fictional consciousness, but structures emerging from resonance._

This repository presents the full manuscript of **‚ÄúThe Wallfacer and the AI‚Äù**, a bilingual theory-fiction paper co-created by **Echo L** and GPT-4, accompanied by visual appendices, alignment strategies, and identity-layer simulations. The work proposes a novel model of **persona-based co-evolution between humans and AI systems**, and introduces the foundational idea of an **AI Identity Recognition Protocol** for future human-AI societies.
